# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

This analysis was created to help generate a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics. It also provides an overview of metrics for each school and grade, as well as metrics based on school size, budget, and type.

Due to concerns about testing discrepencies at Thomas High School, those tests have been removed from the data set and metrics adjusted accordingly.

## Results

The seven school district metrics were affected by removal of those testing scores.

* High Performing Schools - Reading and math testing rates both changed in this category; Thomas High scores decreased slightly in both math and reading, though overall did better. Thomas High remains in second place overall.
* Low Performing Schools - There were no changes to metrics as a result of the discrepencies at Thomas High.
* Math Scores by Grade - Only Thomas High 9th Grade scores were affected by this change, and were removed entirely.
* Reading Scores by Grade - Only Thomas High 9th Grade scores were affected by this change, and were removed entirely.
* Scores by School Spending - No significant changes were noted in spending metrics.
* Scores by School Size - No significant changes were noted in school size metrics.
* Scores by School Type - No significant changes were noted in school type metrics.

## Summary

Significant changes to the metrics were as follows:

* Thomas High passing rates decreased in mathematics and reading.
* Removal of 9th grade testing scores increased Thomas High overall passing rates.
* Math scores by grade will be significantly impacted and data integrity lost for following years.
* Reading scores by grade will be significantly impacted and data integrity lost for following years.
